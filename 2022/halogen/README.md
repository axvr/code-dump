# Halogen

> [!NOTE]
> An experiment to replace the [Halboy](https://github.com/jimmythompson/halboy) library (allowing interacting with APIs that expose HAL resources).  Ultimately, I would go on to supersede this project by embracing the data aspect of HAL resources by creating a single, ~10 line function that would resolve HAL links from a response and directly use standard Clojure HTTP client libraries.

A compliant and reliable HAL library for Clojure.
